## Overview

The **Avian Migration Modeling** project uses statistical modeling and data science techniques to analyze bird migration patterns. The main goal is to integrate eBird data with environmental variables, such as temperature, precipitation, and habitat type, to identify factors influencing bird movement and migration.

## Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:RalphtheWaldo/avian_migration_modeling.git

## Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can run the main script to start analyzing migration patterns.

Run the main analysis script:
python main.py

Check data sources:
The project integrates data from eBird and environmental datasets. You can access the raw data in the /data directory.
